* Cascade

It would be easier if the PREPROC would be truly static windowsâ€¦

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer and all counters
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

* Wavelength calibration

Think of setup.base_freq and setup.lbd0, to see if it make
sens to keep them in these units.
setup.base_freq may be better defined pixel/lbd

Ask John for absolute scale/wavelength.

The detector has a PSD with a pic every 10 pixels (fft)
Thus with period 32 = outputs

* RTS

Use the dark at the time of the RTS ?

Photometry extraction:
Think on the dimensions...

DC: compute the DC residual in fringes
and reproject it into the dc-shape.

* VIS

Flatten the time ?

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 and t3phi with bootstraping

Use morphological closing/opening to better deal with SNR curves.

* Speed-up

- save the PREPROC and RTS in float32 instead of float64.
When reading them, we can convert them again in float64 with astype.

- QC of dc is too long
- Apply thresholding (force zeros) is too long
