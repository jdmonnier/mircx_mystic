* Test data and food for thought

Various gain, with several flux.
BACKGROUND and BEAM, and ideally with MIRROR.

I confirm not all the photometric beams have reflection.
It is *only* beam 5. (2017Oct06/reduced_jb/*beam5*pfit.png)

I confirm that the noise in increasing in the fringe window.
This is almost invisible in the flux and err however.

* Cascade

It would be easier if the PREPROC would be truly static windowsâ€¦

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer and all counters
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

Compute preproc per RAW file, to better allow selection.

The interference removal create correlation between the photometric flux.
This is not good for normalisation power.

* Wavelength calibration

Think of setup.base_freq and setup.lbd0, to see if it make
sens to keep them in these units.
setup.base_freq may be better defined pixel/lbd

Ask John for absolute scale/wavelength.

* RTS

Load several PREPROC into a single RTS ???
Or load various RTS into a single VIS ???

Use the dark at the time of the RTS ?

Photometry extraction:
Think on the dimensions...

DC: compute the DC residual in fringes
and reproject it into the dc-shape.
Which frequency ??

* VIS

Deal with coherent integration as time quantities

Flatten the time ?

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 and t3phi with bootstraping

Use morphological closing/opening to better deal with SNR curves.

* Speed-up

- QC of dc is too long
- Apply thresholding (force zeros) is too long
