* Re-do the window management, based on existing value in RAW headers

* Spectral calibration

* Photometry extraction

Think on the dimensions...

* Photometry normalisation

Require fringe selection (GD)
for the correlation plots to be valid

Deal with photometric normalisation in way
that the photo signal in RTS is the normalisation
including the kappa-matrix

* OIFITS

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 with bootstraping

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer
