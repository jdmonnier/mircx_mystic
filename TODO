* Spectral calibration

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer
Use a flat-field

* Photometry extraction

Think on the dimensions...

* Photometry normalisation

Require fringe selection (GD)
for the correlation plots to be valid

* OIFITS

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 with bootstraping
