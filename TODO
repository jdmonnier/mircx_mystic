* Cascade

It would be easier if the PREPROC would be truly static windowsâ€¦

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

* Use the dark at the time of the RTS ?

* Photometry extraction

Think on the dimensions...

* OIFITS

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 and t3phi with bootstraping

* Wavelength calibration

Think of setup.base_freq and setup.lbd0, to see if it make
sens to keep them in these units.
setup.base_freq may be better defined pixel/lbd

* Speed-up

- save the PREPROC and RTS in float32 instead of float64.
When reading them, we can convert them again in float64 with astype.

- QC of dc is too long
- Apply thresholding (force zeros) is too long
