* Test data and food for thought

Various gain, with several flux.
BACKGROUND and BEAM, and ideally with MIRROR.

We can see the noise structure in the background.
Gain 60 shall be favored.

I confirm not all the photometric beams have reflection.
It is *only* beam 5. (2017Oct06/reduced_jb/*beam5*pfit.png)

I confirm that the noise in increasing in the fringe window.
This is almost invisible in the flux and err however.

* Cascade

It would be easier if the PREPROC would be truly static windowsâ€¦

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer and all counters
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

Compute preproc per RAW file, to better allow selection.

The interference removal create correlation between the photometric flux.
This is *not* good for normalisation power.

* Wavelength calibration

Think of setup.base_freq and setup.lbd0, to see if it make
sens to keep them in these units.
setup.base_freq may be better defined pixel/lbd

Ask John for absolute scale/wavelength.

* RTS

Load several PREPROC into a single RTS ???
Or load various RTS into a single VIS ???

Photometry extraction:
Think on the dimensions...

Which frequency to retroject the DC residual ??

How to deal with the kappa ? Wouldn't the DC projection be sufficient
if we assume the kappa is the same for all telescopes ?

* VIS

First do the longest SNR average (ramp).
Then bootstrap, then perform the fringe selection

Deal with coherent integration as time quantities
Flatten the time ?

How to compute the error bars ?

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 and t3phi with bootstraping


* Speed-up

- QC of dc is too long
- Apply thresholding (force zeros) is too long
