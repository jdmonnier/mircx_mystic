* Test data and food for thought

Various gain, with several flux.
BACKGROUND and BEAM, and ideally with MIRROR.

We can see the noise structure in the background.
Gain 60 shall be favored.

I confirm not all the photometric beams have reflection.
It is *only* beam 5. (2017Oct06/reduced_jb/*beam5*pfit.png)

I confirm that the noise in increasing in the fringe window.
This is almost invisible in the flux and err however.

* Cascade

It would be easier if the PREPROC would be truly static windowsâ€¦

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer and all counters
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

Compute preproc per RAW file, to better allow selection.

The interference removal create correlation between the photometric flux.
This is *not* good for normalisation power.

Compute the QUALITY of beam based on SNR of the x-chan fit, not mean flux.
Because integrating many frames should help.

* RTS

Or load various RTS into a single VIS.

Photometry extraction:
Think on the dimensions...

Which frequency to retroject the DC residual ??

Shall we retroproject the DC residual for
each wavelength independently ??

How to deal with the kappa ? Wouldn't the DC projection be sufficient
if we assume the kappa is the same for all telescopes ?

Maybe the spectral-kappa shall be taken as the best of the night,
and only the total flux ratio should be adjusted.
Because the SNR on the edges is really small.

* VIS

Deal with coherent integration as time quantities
Flatten the time ?

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD

* Speed-up

- QC of dc is too long
- Apply thresholding (force zeros) is too long
- Add option to rereduce only part of the night

* VISCAL

Propagate uncertainties on transfer function
and calibrated product with non-linear propagation
(compute at + and - sigma).

Add the beamorder in the setup for viscal... as a 
reconfiguration is not catched yet.
