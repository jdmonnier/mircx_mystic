* Spectral calibration

* Preproc

Propagate the frame_numer
Use a flat-field and bad pixel

* Use the dark at the time of the RTS ?

* Photometry extraction

Think on the dimensions...

* OIFITS

Better MJD, better INT_TIME, better UCOORD,VCOORD
Compute errors on vis2 and t3phi with bootstraping

* Wavelength calibration
